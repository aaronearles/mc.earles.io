## Status
This is not currently working since migrating from Organizational Repo, need to setup vars & secrets in /images directory

## Reminder: A Repository level Variable `b2_tfstate_key` is REQUIRED.

All other variables declared in `variables.tf` are set either at `Organization` level in Github, or defined in `terraform.tfvars`
